Pictor is a Decentralized GPU Rendering Network utilizing Blockchain to provide secure, efficient, and scalable rendering solutions.

In our increasingly visual world, the demand for complex and diverse images is ever-growing. Technological advancements continually broaden the possibilities for working with visual elements, expanding their applications across numerous fields.

Rendering is essential in various industries. Architects and industrial engineers use them to plan, visualize, and test their projects. Scientists simulate environments, while video game developers, TV and movie producers, and other entertainment professionals create engaging visual content. In medicine, rendering technologies enable advancements like simulators for practicing or even help in performing surgeries. The rapid growth of the Metaverse, VR (virtual reality), AR (augmented reality), and their applications further extends every industry mentioned and beyond.

As our lives become more digital, we are increasingly immersed in CG worlds. Artists and studios are adopting innovative content creation methods, leading to greater complexity for themselves. The need for large-scale computation tasks and real-time virtual experiences requires not only more resources but also new ways to exchange digital content.

Therefore, it is essential to bridge the gap between technological breakthroughs and widespread accessibility to them. In order to bridge the gap, computing power or rendering power needs to be democratized.

This is the mission of the Pictor Network.
